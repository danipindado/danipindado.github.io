Pool swim is a [ConnectIQ app](https://apps.garmin.com/es-ES/apps/f134a024-6ee4-47d3-8aec-3a397e3c9733){:target="_blank"} for the Garmin FR230, FR235 and FR630.

My previous running watch was a Suunto ambit2s. I used to combine the running watch with a Pebble smartwatch which I used as my day-to-day watch. 

But, the Pebble stopped working, and, feeling that the ambit was more watch that I needed (I am just a recreational runner), I got rid of it and bought a Garmin FR230 to fullfill both needs. Besides I am a tech geek and ConnectIQ platform was appealing. 

Then this year I have begun to swim... and given the lack of swim support of the FR230, I found the perfect excuse to write my first ConnectIQ app.

The app provides support for [FR230](http://a-fwd.com/es=danpinblo01-21&it=danpinblo03-21&fr=blodedanpin0d-21&de=danpinblo0d-21&uk=danpinblo-21&com=danpinblo-21&e=RR3Mjl7n30G6nQDUx3AT7&asin-com=B016PAPI3W){:target="_blank"}, [FR235](http://a-fwd.com/es=danpinblo01-21&it=danpinblo03-21&fr=blodedanpin0d-21&de=danpinblo0d-21&uk=danpinblo-21&com=danpinblo-21&e=RR3Mjl7n30G6nQDUx3AT7&asin-com=B0160BC1FO){:target="_blank"} and [FR630](http://a-fwd.com/es=danpinblo01-21&it=danpinblo03-21&fr=blodedanpin0d-21&de=danpinblo0d-21&uk=danpinblo-21&com=danpinblo-21&e=RR3Mjl7n30G6nQDUx3AT7&asin-com=B016VC1PTU){:target="_blank"}.
These are watches meant for runners. Therefore, Garmin did not include the swim pool mode. 

you can find the user guide [here]({{ site.url }}/downloads/pool_swim_user_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} .
I know user guides are no fun. But I really recommend you to take a look. Most of the answers users have asked me since I released the apps are answered there. 

In [this new post](https://danipindado.github.io/Pool-Swim-app-v4.2-released.html){:target="_blank"} I have described how to buttons work for the FR630 after v4.2. I disabled the touch screen for better usability. 
And [here](https://danipindado.github.io/pool-swim-app-v4-3-released.html){:target="_blank"} you learn how to deal with imperial metrics.

Just in case you don't read the user guide, just a couple of hints:


 + the app, unlike most of you think, does not work on accelerometers. it works on the compass. 
 + For proper function, the app needs to figure out your pool's orientation. This happens during the first 10 seconds of the activity. **Please do not press start if you are not going to swim inmmediately**. Just saying.
 + **When you have a short break, press stop to pause the activity** (f.i. when resting, adjusting goggles, ...). Otherwise it is likely that the compass will eventually trigger a lap. 
 + **The app tracks heart rate**. This is something no very common out there. For the FR235 obviously the optical HRM is being used. For FR230 and FRE630 you need an optical HRM. I am using [Scosche Rhythm+](http://a-fwd.com/es=danpinblo01-21&it=danpinblo03-21&fr=blodedanpin0d-21&de=danpinblo0d-21&uk=danpinblo-21&com=danpinblo-21&e=RR3Mjl7n30G6nQDUx3AT7&asin-com=B00JQHTJS2){:target="_blank"}. I wear it around the wrist, close to the watch, and i am very happy with it.
