title: Evaluate your aerobic capacity with the Ruffier-Dickson index
---
The [Ruffier-Dickson index](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_de_Ruffier#Variante:_.C3.8Dndice_de_Ruffier-Dickson) is a test that is performed to measure short-term aerobic endurance and cardiac resilience, and thus a person's fitness level.

The index is a variant of the one defined by the french doctor [James-Edward Ruffier](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James-Edward_Ruffier).

It is a test based on a formula that serves to obtain a coefficient that gives us an assessment about our state of form. Said coefficient is obtained by performing 30 leg pressures of a time of 45 seconds . 1

P0 = Pulsations per minute at rest (basal). 
P1 = Pulses per minute after exercise (adaptation). 
P2 = Pulses per minute after one minute of recovery (recovery). 

 {\ Displaystyle I_d = ((P1-70) + 2 * (P2-P0)) / 10} {\ Displaystyle I_d = ((P1-70) + 2 * (P2-P0)) / 10} .

Where:

I = 0-3: excellent 
I = 3-6: normal 
I = 6-8: weak 
I => 8: Inappropriate
