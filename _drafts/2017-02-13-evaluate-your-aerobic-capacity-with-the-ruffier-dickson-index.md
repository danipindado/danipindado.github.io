title: Evaluate your aerobic capacity with the Ruffier-Dickson index
---
The [Ruffier-Dickson index](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_de_Ruffier#Variante:_.C3.8Dndice_de_Ruffier-Dickson) is a test to measure aerobic endurance, and thus a person's fitness level.

The index is a variant of the one defined by the french doctor [James-Edward Ruffier](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James-Edward_Ruffier).

This test is based on a formula that serves to obtain a coefficient that gives us an assessment about our fitness level. Said coefficient is obtained by performing 30 squats in 45 seconds:

The following parameters are defined:


- **P0** = Heart rate right before the exercise begins 
- **P1** = Heart rate just when exercise finishes 
- **P2** = Heart rate after one minute recovery 

 {\ Displaystyle I_d = ((P1-70) + 2 * (P2-P0)) / 10} {\ Displaystyle I_d = ((P1-70) + 2 * (P2-P0)) / 10} .

Where:

I = 0-3: excellent 
I = 3-6: normal 
I = 6-8: weak 
I => 8: Inappropriate 

Now you can measure your Ruffier-Dickson index with my [new app](https://apps.garmin.com/es-ES/apps/3448594e-c17a-4c78-8ccf-5ec0cb2d10be).

Using the app is pretty straight forward. 

Just stay in rest position and press start. the following three phases will be automatically triggered:


- 15 seconds rest time, for estimation of P0
- 45 seconds exercise time. Here you have to perform 30 squats. At the end of this phase P1 will be estimated
- 60 seconds recovery time, after which P2 and Id are estimated

Hint: you can use [this metronome](http://a.bestmetronome.com/) to help you keep the rhythm. You need to set the the *beats for minute* at 40 bpm. Press start and you are good to go. 

During the test, the watch will show you the phase you actually are in, and how many seconds remain till next phase:

Once finished, the app will show the estimated index:

After syncing your will find the Garmin Connect all calculated parameters:

And of course, the heart rate chart during the 2 minutes of the test:
