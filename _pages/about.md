I am a spanish guy living in Germany with a passion for technology and programming.
When I became 40 I begun to run, probably [a sign of a midlife crisis](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2643854/Are-running-marathon-getting-facelift-tattoo-Youre-probably-grip-mid-life-crisis.html) :)

Writing apps for wearables was the obvious step. I begun writing apps for Suunto watches, and since sometime I have begun writing apps using Garmin's ConnectIQ platform.
