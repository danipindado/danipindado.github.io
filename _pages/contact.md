You can use the comment section below to contact me. 
Remember that you don't need to create a Disqus account in order to comment: just write your comment, click on the "Name" field below, and the option "I'd rather post as a guest" will pop up.
Comments post as a guest do not get public until I approve. So in case you do not want the comment to be published, this is the way to go.
